For n=10 and r=1, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.544
For n=10 and r=2, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.74
For n=10 and r=3, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.831
For n=10 and r=4, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.792
For n=10 and r=5, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.728
For n=10 and r=6, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.668
For n=10 and r=7, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.591
For n=10 and r=8, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.52
For n=10 and r=9, the area under the ROC curve is: 0.512

The models where r=1 and r=9 both perform very poorly, but for different reasons.
The former performs poorly because we are looking to match continguous strings of length 1, which often is the case (by chance) when we try to classify inputs that merely use the same alphabet as the training set.
The latter performs poorly because we are overfitting by trying to match very long continguous strings.

r=3 yields the best results as the area under the ROC curve is largest, namely 0.831.

For hiligaynon, 	MAX(AUC) = 0.84
For middle-english, MAX(AUC) = 0.542
For plautdietsch, 	MAX(AUC) = 0.775
For xhosa, 			MAX(AUC) = 0.889

The model performs best on xhosa, and worst on middle-english.
If we inspect the corpus of xhosa, we encounter strings such as:
bini_babuy
ngadyobhek
qinela_uku
halo_nalil
esi_sifo_a
lo_uyesu_k
The combination of letters is very different from those in English. There aren't many words in english that contain substrings such as "dyo" or "uye". Hence, the words are seen as non-self.

The middle-english corpus is much more similar to English:
m_what_sek
hal_be_if_
we_he_wold
_haue_spok
We see letter combinations that we encounter often in English and some words even are part of the English language. Therefore, it is much more difficult to distinguish self from non-self.
